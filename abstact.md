### Abstract:

This module demonstrates a basic technique for system call hooking in the Linux kernel, specifically targeting the `open()` system call. System call hooking allows custom functionality to be inserted into existing kernel operations, which can be used for a variety of purposes such as security monitoring, logging, or modifying system behavior. In this example, the module intercepts calls to the `open()` system call and logs the file being opened before passing control to the original `open()` function. 

The hooking process involves locating the system call table, disabling write protection on critical kernel memory regions, and replacing the `open()` system call entry with a custom function. The module restores the original functionality of the `open()` system call upon unloading. This technique, while useful in various security applications, poses risks such as potential system instability and the possibility of detection by security software, as it involves low-level manipulation of kernel memory and CPU control registers.

This approach demonstrates how kernel modules can be leveraged to monitor or modify system behavior in real-time, providing valuable insights into system operations while emphasizing the importance of safe and secure implementation practices.
